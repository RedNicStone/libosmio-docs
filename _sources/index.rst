libosmio Docs - Main branch
===========================

Welcome to the official documentation of the osmio project, a fast and universal library for low level communication.
This document contains everything you need to know about libosmio, from how to open an interface to implementing your own ICDs.
If you are just starting out with the osmio ecosystem, I recommend that you read the :ref:´introduction page <doc_about>´.
